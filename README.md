# AIRS PS Workshop

Repository for a multi-part workshop on building AI applications and securing them with Palo Alto Networks Runtime Security.

- Start here for the n8n lab: `n8n/WORKSHOP.md`
- Infra as code: `n8n/terraform/`
- K8s templates: `n8n/templates/` (Terraform renders temporary manifests into `n8n/gen/`)

Notes for collaborators:
- Keep the root README high level. Put lab instructions in `n8n/WORKSHOP.md`.
- Use `AGENTS.md` for agent workflow and repo rules.
- Private, non-committed work logs live in `.private/` (see `.private/PLAN.md` and `.private/NOTES.md`).
