# AIRS PS Workshop

Repository for a multi-part workshop on building AI applications and securing them with Palo Alto Networks Runtime Security.

- Start here for the n8n lab: `n8n/WORKSHOP.md`
- Infra as code: `n8n/terraform/`
- K8s templates: `n8n/templates/` (Terraform renders temporary manifests into `n8n/gen/`)
